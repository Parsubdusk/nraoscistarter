# Quick Start Guide - NRAO Spectrum Sentinels

## Step 1: Download Project Files

1. **From Replit**: Click the download button or use the menu to download all files
2. **Extract** the files to a folder like `C:\SpectrumX\` or your Desktop
3. **Open terminal** in that folder (see previous instructions for opening terminal)

## Step 2: Run the Setup Script

In the terminal, type:
```bash
python setup_local.py
```

This script will:
- ✓ Install all required Python packages automatically
- ✓ Set up your SDR Sharp path (`C:\Users\coraj\OneDrive\Desktop\sdrsharp-x86`)
- ✓ Configure the database 
- ✓ Start the server at `http://localhost:5000`

## Alternative: Manual Setup

If the setup script doesn't work, you can run these commands manually:

```bash
# Install packages
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy waitress numpy scipy requests matplotlib plotly

# Start the server
python run_server.py
```

## What You'll Get

Once running:
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: `http://localhost:5000`
- 📁 **File Upload**: Upload SDR recordings for RFI analysis
- 📊 **Heat Map**: Interactive visualization of RFI detections
- 🔧 **SDR Sharp**: Launch button will open your SDR Sharp installation
- 💾 **Database**: `rf_data.db` file stores all your data

## Troubleshooting

**"Python not found"**: Install Python 3.8+ from python.org
**"Missing files"**: Make sure you downloaded ALL files from Replit
**"Permission denied"**: Run terminal as administrator on Windows
**"SDR Sharp not found"**: The app will work but the SDR launch button won't function
