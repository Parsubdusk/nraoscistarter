# NRAO Spectrum Sentinels

## Overview

NRAO Spectrum Sentinels is a citizen science web application designed to detect and catalog radio frequency interference (RFI) in radio astronomy observations. The platform allows users to upload SDR (Software Defined Radio) recordings, which are then automatically analyzed for RFI patterns using signal processing algorithms. The application serves as a collaborative tool for protecting radio astronomy research by crowdsourcing RFI detection and analysis, with affiliations to SciStarter and SpectrumX.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

**Web Framework**: Flask-based web application with SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations. The application follows a traditional MVC pattern with clear separation between models, routes, and templates.

**Database Design**: Uses SQLAlchemy with a flexible database configuration supporting both SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production). Core entities include:
- Recording: Stores uploaded audio file metadata and processing status
- RFIDetection: Contains detected interference events with frequency, power level, and confidence metrics
- UserSession: Tracks user contributions for citizen science logging
- ProcessingQueue: Manages asynchronous RFI analysis tasks

**Signal Processing Engine**: Custom RFI detection system using NumPy and SciPy for digital signal processing. Implements threaded background processing to analyze uploaded recordings without blocking the web interface. Detection algorithms focus on identifying anomalous power levels and frequency patterns characteristic of interference.

**File Management**: Configurable upload system supporting multiple audio formats (WAV, FLAC, OGG, MP3, raw IQ data). Files are stored locally with metadata tracking and size limits (500MB max).

**Session Management**: Flask sessions with UUID-based user tracking including mandatory age verification (18+) and location collection for research compliance. Users must provide consent for data use and location information before participating in the citizen science project.

**Visualization System**: Interactive heat map visualization using HTML5 Canvas and Chart.js for displaying RFI detection patterns across time and frequency domains. Real-time filtering and zoom capabilities for data exploration.

**Background Processing**: Asynchronous task processing using Python threading for RFI analysis. Processing queue system ensures scalable handling of multiple uploads while providing status tracking.

## External Dependencies

**SciStarter API Integration**: RESTful API integration for logging citizen science contributions as an affiliate partner. Tracks user activities and metadata for research impact measurement. Uses bearer token authentication with configurable project identifiers.

**SDR Sharp Integration**: Automated SDR Sharp configuration and launch system that pre-configures optimal RFI detection settings (48kHz WAV, 25 RF gain, proper output directory). Eliminates manual setup requirements for users.

**Bootstrap UI Framework**: Frontend built with Bootstrap 5 dark theme for responsive design. Uses Feather Icons for consistent iconography and Chart.js for data visualization components.

**Waitress WSGI Server**: Production-ready WSGI server configuration with threading support for handling concurrent requests and background processing tasks.

**Third-party JavaScript Libraries**: 
- Chart.js for statistical visualizations and real-time plotting
- Feather Icons for scalable vector iconography
- Bootstrap for responsive UI components and form handling
